"Behave identically to MS Paint."  Sort of.

Tool-specific menu below.  GTK font selection dropdown and font type selection.
    - in the tool option selector... whatever

Text entry/wrapping behaviour:
    No wrapping, just run the current line off the edge.

User interaction with the on-canvas text-entry widget:
    - requirement: should be able to switch between editing and repositioning
    - implementation: borderless text-entry widget surrounded by a border?
      (rasterize the widget upon committing the text)

Correct undo/redo behaviour. (by which I mean nuking the text)


Implementation doodles:
    - get a floating text tool (with a border)
    - figure out how to dynamically reposition it
    - figure out how to rasterize it and apply it to the canvas pixbuf
